# Introduction
An important, emerging field with a lot of potential. 

# Tutorials
1. [An Illustrated Guide to Graph Neural Networks](https://medium.com/dair-ai/an-illustrated-guide-to-graph-neural-networks-d5564a551783)

A very basic guide to get started

# Courses
1. [CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w)

Excellent course for learning about, well, graph machine learning. Have pretty up-to-date information about the current graph neural network research. Unfortunately, the course's videos are not officially available. We can probably find most of the videos from Youtube by searching for cs224w, though.
