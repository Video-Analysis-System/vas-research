# Video Modeling with Correlation Networks
Correlation layer enables the network to train faster and models the motion explicitly. The official source code is possibly not available til CVPR 2020 so we need to ask the author for the source code. 

One idea I have in mind is that, could we use the correlation modeling idea for self-supervised learning?
