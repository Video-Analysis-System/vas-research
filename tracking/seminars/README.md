# Introduction
We plan to hold a bi-weekly seminar at 4pm on Thursday afternoon. For now, we'll focus on the topic of object tracking, which is a very important component of our toolbox. In each seminar, a team member will present at least 1 topic and walk through its code so that hopefully, at the end, everyone will have a good understanding of the paper and will be able to experiment with the code easily.
