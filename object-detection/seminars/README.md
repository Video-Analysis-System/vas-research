# Introduction
We plan to hold a seminar every Friday afternoon. For now, we'll focus on the topic of object detection, which is a very important component of our toolbox. In each seminar, a team member will present at least 1 paper and walk through its code so that hopefully, at the end, everyone will have a good understanding of the paper and will be able to experiment with the code easily.

# List of papers to choose for seminars
This is an initial list of recommended papers that we can choose for our presentation. As our knowledge and skills grow, we'll surely make changes to this list. Please, feel free to add your favourite papers to this collection so that we'll have many more interesting papers to learn from.
