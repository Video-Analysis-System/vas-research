# Introduction
This page aims to collect useful resources for learning object detection, apart from our seminars & monthly coding exercises. Please, share your favourite tutorials, courses and books.

# Tutorials
## [Dive into deep learning](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/index.html)
This one is quite helpful for me (Vinh). Like the rest of this wonderful book, it is easy to follow with hands-on coding.

# Surveys
## [Object Detection in 20 Years: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05055)
A very comprehensive overview. It's a pity that it's a bit old. We need to update it with more recent techniques.
